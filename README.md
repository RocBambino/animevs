# Anime VS+

Anime VS+ is a multiplatform card game exploring universes from popular video games and anime series. Players can enjoy solo modes, customize their experience, and earn rewards by conquering the multiverse.

## Getting Started
New players begin with three starter universe cards, the title "Starter," the arm "Stock," and the summon "Chick." Progress through single-player modes to earn coins and upgrade your items.

## Card Mechanics
Each card has stats like health, stamina, attack, and defense. Cards feature five abilities: three attack moves, one enhancer, and one block. Attack moves have different stamina costs and effects. Enhancers boost stats or inflict status effects, and blocks double defense for one turn.

## Card Types and Levels
Cards come in various types such as Universe Cards, Dungeon Cards, Boss Cards, and more. They also have passive elements, tiers, affinities, unique passives, universe traits, and destinies. Card levels increase with battles, starting at level 0 and maxing out at level 3500.

## Damage, Elements, and Talismans
Damage calculation considers engagement levels, speed (evasion), and strike accuracy. Talismans can nullify certain elemental affinities, providing strategic advantages.

## Titles, Arms, and Summons
Titles and arms modify stats and apply enhancers. Titles are universe-specific, while arms break over time but can be repaired. Summons assist in battles with elemental attacks or defensive boosts, and can be earned through various game modes.

## Battle Mechanics
Players take turns using their abilities, with standard stamina costs. The match ends when a player's health reaches zero. Focus and resolve states allow for recovery and transformation, enhancing stats and enabling summon assistance.

## Difficulty and Progression
Three difficulty levels are available: Easy, Normal, and Hard. Each offers different scaling, drops, and rewards. Players can tailor their experience to their desired challenge level.

## Game Modes
- **Tales**: Single-player adventures in various universes.
- **Dungeon**: Harder versions of tales with better loot.
- **Scenario**: Various scenarios from source materials.
- **Explore**: Random encounters for coins and cards.

## Presets
Players can save and manage their favorite builds using presets.

## Economy
The marketplace allows for buying and selling cards, arms, and summons. Players can trade items, dismantle them into gems and essence, and purchase upgrades at the blacksmith.

## Guilds
Guilds offer additional bonuses and a community aspect. Players can create, join, and donate to guilds, earning extra rewards and buffs. Guild roles include owner, officer, captain, and member, each with specific privileges.

By understanding these elements, players can strategically navigate Anime VS+, maximize their card potential, and enjoy immersive multiverse adventures.
